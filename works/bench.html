            <p>[01/09/2018, 16:38] <br> Mom: When can we skype? <br>[01/09/2018, 18:49] <br> Me: Well, whenever is convenient for you. <br> Me: Whenever grandma comes home. <br>Mom: She is out on the bench now. <br> Me: I thought so.</p>
            <p><em>I walk the streets of my hometown from my own memory, and I can remember the places where someone’s eyes were fixed on me passing, greeting me kindly, asking where I’m headed. I remember those places I have stopped to rest, the places where I have waited to meet, or stood up from to leave. The same place right outside our door, where I have walked my grandma to, so she can enjoy her afternoons with the other old ladies from the neighbourhood. <br> I try to remember how the bench in front of my home looks, but I can’t picture it fully. I remember it grey, with a rough surface, the wood getting old and brittle, but not old enough to feel unsafe. You know, the older an object is, the sturdier and long-lasting it is. I don’t remember it not being there, it has always been, leaning on that apartment building’s facade, right at the entrance to the yard, to the right of the fence… </em></p>
            <h3>Chapter 1: An architectural element</h3>
            <p>‘Each bench [...] should be preferably placed where there is, for example, a small space within space, a niche, a corner, a place that offers intimacy and security and, as a rule, a good microclimate as well.’ Designing public spaces involves studying the public, in a biological and sociological sense. How the crowd moves and spreads within the urban environment, what are their physical and social needs. Public spaces are not just walking paths and squares, but spaces to meet, separate, pause, observe and connect. For that reason, sitting spaces become a crucial (and a fascinating) part of urban planning, where the placement of benches is done with the intention to create a sustainable and well functioning ecosystem. ‘The most popular places to sit can be found at the edges of open spaces, where the sitter’s back is protected, the view unobstructed, and the local climate is most favourable.’</p>
            <p><em>…To the side of the bench, as part of the facade, there is a metal sort of a door. Its only function is to display obituaries, the faces and names of people who perhaps also lived in the neighbourhood, perhaps they also used to walk past the bench, sit on it, meet up with others and share their stories. <br>But maybe I remember it completely wrong. I can mostly remember the bench as this vague image, rather a concept or an idea, encapsulating stories, memories and emotions of the people coming and going.</em></p>
            <p>The main purpose of a bench is not sitting whatsoever but rather stepping away from the crowd and observing the surroundings. For that matter, the overview, the sensory command of a large and diverse scene is highly valued. ‘The opportunities of seeing other people are, as has been discussed, a question of distance between observer and object. If the streets are too wide and the spaces too big, the opportunity of being able to view, from one place, the space and the events going on is more or less lost.’ Benches tend to appear at the margins of public squares, to the side of walking paths, in parks, or as in this case, in front of housing buildings. They shape the space as recreational, while creating the opportunity to connect with the surroundings. Furthermore, benches in residential areas, by their mere existence within a micro-environment, create a greater value of the same functions. Repetition in the conversational exchanges establish and solidify connections, moreover, build local communities.</p>
