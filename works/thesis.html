        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>It’s June 2020, in the middle of a global pandemic, massive protests against racial injustice are taking
          place
          around the world, carried out by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. A revolution, the motives of which had
          built up for decades, was triggered by the police murder of George Floyd and started a new wave of protests
          with
          the appeal for legislative reforms against police brutality. In addition to verbal pleas, the demonstrations
          also engaged with the physical symbols of oppression. A chain of monument removals started, one of which was
          the
          destruction of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, England (fig.1). Some argued against the
          toppling with the position that monuments are artefacts with historical and cultural value. In response to the
          events, art historian Arnold Bartetzky writes, “Liberal societies should be able to endure that not everything
          that is in public spaces corresponds to our current world view. That is exactly what distinguishes us from
          dictatorships and autocratic regimes”<sup>1</sup>. But that doesn’t apply to Colton’s statue. The monument was
          put up in
          1895, long after Colston’s death, thus it has nothing much to do with his life in the 17th
          century<sup>2</sup>. It was a
          historical ‘artefact’ that forces a specific interpretation of how the past should be perceived in the
          present.
          Monuments (from the Latin monere - to remind) are meant to withstand time and create open spaces to engage the
          viewers forcing them into creating associations<sup>3</sup>, by commemorating or even glorifying historical
          events and
          figures. This preservation of memory is a necessary practice in the formation of national identity. And in the
          case of Colston’s monument, the historical figure is mythologized to the extent of rewriting history, in order
          to sustain the idea of white supremacy in society. These intentions start to clash when the supposedly
          glorified
          figures have engaged in actions that were immoral or violent. Hence, the act of commemoration of the past
          through solid structures is regarded more critically by taking into consideration the truth and to what extent
          they (mis)represent history and our current values. In that sense, the engagement with the physical
          environment
          during the BLM protests rallies was an act that solidified their statement of breaking with the cycle of
          subjugation.</p>

            on Sunday, June 7.</small>
        <p>Having these events linger in my mind for almost two years, I started recognising links to my personal
          background. Born and raised in Bulgaria, a post-socialist country, after the collapse of the Soviet bloc in
          1989, I grew up around buildings and monuments that were reminders of a past ideology. It was a system that
          modelled society into controlled masses who trusted and served the state unquestionably, something that
          doesn’t
          apply to the current state of democracy. Some of the symbols of communism were demolished by the state, others
          were abandoned, slowly crumbling and losing their initial functions. But they still haunt people. Even people
          like me, who have never lived in the socialist era feel its presence through its residue. Public opinions
          about
          whether Soviet architecture should be demolished or preserved have been polarised<sup>4</sup>, tearing the
          image of these
          structures between a nostalgic memory and a horrid urban scrap. In my opinion, Soviet buildings, similar to
          the
          statue of Edward Colson, are solid structures linked, in one way or another, to the practice of gaining power
          through oppression. At first glance, these examples seem quite different. Colonial monuments exploit the past
          to
          sustain a certain ideology for present and future generations. On the other hand, Soviet culture halls, for
          example, are not intended as a commemoration of the past. They were rather borrowing ideas from the future.
          And
          within the Soviet context, they acted as a celebration of the present, bringing society together and further
          inspiring trust in the state. Both Soviet and colonial structures have been treated more like conceptual art
          pieces with a certain approach towards society. In our contemporary environment, Soviet buildings become
          either
          a direct portal to a past infiltrated with manipulation and oppression, or lose their intended role in
          modelling
          society, since the state is no more relying on populism.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the generation born after ’89 (including myself) dominates the art and pop culture scene– a
          field established through capitalist ideologies but situated in a hybrid urban environment of modern
          architecture and ruins of Socialism. An example of this mixed cityscape came from a recent trip to Moldova. My
          first impression of Chișinău formed at my arrival in a luxurious airport (fig.2). Once I left it however and
          headed towards the city, I was welcomed by the City Gates (fig.3), a complex of Soviet housing buildings,
          making
          the impression of gates that welcome the city’s guests. This fusion between the two realities reflected onto
          the
          presence of obsolete architecture is what I want to explore through this essay. I’m curious about the
          reappearance of the soviet building in modern (capitalised) pop culture in the form of aesthetics, a tendency
          that strips architecture off from its symbolism. How does the function of a building change through an
          ideological switch and through the prism of a generation that has never encountered the socialist regime? And
          is
          repurposing an art form, regardless of its initial concept, appropriating the historical and cultural
          relevance
          attached to it?</p>

        <h3>Architecture as a carrier of ideas</h3>
        <p>To fully understand the role of Soviet buildings (primarily in the period of late ‘60s to ‘80s), one should
          first look into the semiotics of architecture. Architecture constructs people's urban environment by creating
          or
          enclosing physical spaces, through which it establishes guidelines for movement and inhabitation. The topic of
          a
          building as a carrier of meaning is unfolded in Function and Sign: The Semiotics of Architecture where Italian
          historian and cultural critic Umberto Eco writes about architecture as a language for communicating ideas.
          Similarly to any object of use, a building is designed with a clear intention. It promotes a certain
          function<sup>5</sup>,
          which Eco defines as the denotation of the building or the “form of inhabitation”. Monuments in that case are
          intended as a commemoration of the past. The denotation of Soviet culture halls however is not initially
          commemorative, they are built to host cultural events, but similar to monuments, create space to engage the
          public. Apart from the denotation, Eco introduces the reader to connotative meaning, which signifies the
          ideology of the function<sup>6</sup>. A monument is not only meant to remind of the past. It also connotes
          power, pride
          and
          intent into the formation of national identity, something that also applies to the Soviet culture halls. On
          the
          surface, they require different means of use from the public, but they are both built with the intention to
          unite society around a certain paradigm.
        </p>
        <p>This encryption of meaning is achieved through codes, new unaccustomed elements that imply motives of
          meaning,
          even when the object is not in use. “One is not obliged to characterise a sign on the basis of either
          behaviour
          that it stimulates or actual objects that would verify its meaning: it is characterised only on the basis of
          codified meaning that in a given cultural context is attributed to the sign vehicle.” writes Eco<sup>7</sup>.
          Therefore if
          a
          building’s meaning is codified in the structure, thus solidified in the entirety of the building, the ideology
          becomes encapsulated, able to withstand time, unattached from the inhabitation. An example of this ideological
          implementation is the 1960s Khrushchyovka (fig.4). Named after the Soviet leader at that time, Nikita
          Khrushchev, the type of building came to dominate housing planning all over the USSR and the countries from
          the
          Soviet bloc. These concrete-panel buildings were cheap and easy to build. The fact that they provided equal
          (and
          relatively small) living space to the working class was the reason why they became the ideal embodiment of the
          Communist ideology. Even today, the small cells still remind and represent the Socialist ideals– equality,
          community and sustained life standard by the state. What has changed is the comprehension of these ideas by
          the
          younger generation. What I would argue for is that a building’s connotation hasn’t diminished over time, but
          that it has acquired new meanings. Instead of a symbol for equality and community, now the Khrushchyovka
          appears
          in music videos of artists like the Belarusian band Molchat Doma (fig.5) who use it to visualise topics around
          political stagnation and social crisis in Eastern European countries.

        <p>In Architecture and Utopia: The Semiotics of Architecture Manfredo Tafuri suggests that “architecture, at
          least
          traditionally conceived, is a stable structure, which gives form to permanent values and consolidates urban
          morphology.”<sup>8</sup> For that matter, it is the perfect tool for the visual manifestation of political,
          religious, or
          cultural dogmas. And indeed it was one of the tools used for political propaganda of the Socialist State. Here
          it is helpful to define the differences between ideology and political reality in the Soviet bloc. Communism
          is
          a theory of systems for social organisation, based on the Marxist ideas for complete disregard of social
          classes
          and collective over private ownership. The doctrine describes different stages of the system, with Communism
          at
          its highest level, where the worker is fully devoted to the state with disregard to any personal material
          needs.
          However, for such a socio-economical system to be executed, it would require strong faith in the ideology and
          determination to the state. Else, it is considered to be purely utopian.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utopia, from Greek ou-topos (οὐ τόπος), refers to ‘no place’ or ‘nowhere’, similar
          to
          Greek eu-topos (εὖ τόπος) meaning ‘good place’.<sup>9</sup>
        </p>
        <p>Utopia describes an imaginary society that possesses highly desirable qualities.<sup>10</sup> To reach that
          desirable
          place,
          Soviet society had to endure Socialism first. But since in reality the socialist era didn’t achieve complete
          Communism, it came to be perceived as a period of nothingness, a void filled with ideology and promises,
          implied
          through utopia.<sup>11</sup> As the only drive for the political model becomes a sole intellectual construct,
          that
          construct
          has to be massively manifested to sustain society’s interest. That’s where architecture accepts the task of
          politicising its own handiwork. How George Jepson puts it in the essay “Recourse to Utopia: Architecture and
          the
          Production of Sense without Meaning”: “As agents of politics, architects had to take up the challenge of
          continuously inventing advanced solutions at the most generally applicable levels. Toward this end, ideology
          played a determinant part.”<sup>12</sup> This type of architectural propaganda became very prominent during
          the Stalinist
          era.<sup>13</sup> Architects like Boris Iofan, El Lissitzky and Ivan Leonidov were creating designs with the
          intentions of
          sustaining the state’s ideology (fig.6). A well-known architectural piece was Iofan’s Palace of the Soviets,
          which was an ultimate symbol of dominance during the Stalinist era. The absurdity with this construction is
          the
          intended size and elevation, positioning the state as rather ruling from above than constituted from below.
          Through these imagined structures, the imperialist nature of the system is already noticeable, which
          contradicts
          the constituted Marxist ideas. However these visual masterpieces were never built, only labelled “paper
          architecture”.

        <p>Realised Soviet architecture naturally included grandiose monuments of Vladimir Lenin or Joseph Stalin, as a
          celebration of the Communist leaders, as well as of the working class, like the Worker and Kolkhoz Woman
          (fig.7). However, most of the ideological dogmas were implemented in the communal accommodations, facilities
          and
          even bus stops. There was an emphasis on facilities for leisurе (fig.8), where the workers could rest and
          return
          recharged and more productive.<sup>14</sup> The social model was deeply embedded into the daily routines of
          the citizen, as
          Boris Groys puts it, “the historical accomplishment of communism lies precisely in how it transformed actual
          society into a political model.”<sup>15</sup>

        <p>One particular example I relate to on a personal level is the Buzludzha monument, the House of the Bulgarian
          Communist Party (fig.9). This concrete and steel masterpiece, resembling a flying saucer followed the ’60s
          Soviet achievements in outer space. The structure was one of many that expanded visually on the dreams and
          promises for a utopian future. The opening of the monument in 1981 was a euphoric moment for the general
          public.
          The event was also an opportunity for the state to strengthen society’s beliefs in the communist party and its
          ability to turn futuristic promises into reality. This trustful image of the party was commonly sustained
          through the grandiose architectural achievement of the time. The Buzludzha monument took eight years to build.
          It also remained for eight years, until 1989, when the Soviet Union collapsed and so did the ideology
          manifested
          through the concrete architecture.

        <h3>Architecture in the Post-communist age</h3>

        <p>30 years after these events, remnants of Soviet architecture are still part of the urban environment,
          haunting
          the present with memories from a bittersweet past. In The Post-Communist Condition Groys writes: “The place of
          the communist Utopia once lay solely in the future; today the place of communism lies in the
          past.”<sup>16</sup> And so are
          the monuments that were once a glimpse into the future. Now they are only a ruin, turning the utopian dreams
          encapsulated in them into an unfulfilled promise from a past era. These structures still carry encoded symbols
          of the communist ideology. This makes them alien to their current surroundings: a world built around a
          completely different paradigm. They were physically and ideologically abandoned, yet didn’t undergo full
          demolition. Their leftovers now also belong to the generation born after ’89, a generation, which never
          endured
          any of the indoctrination around architectural symbols. This switch in the political environment together with
          a
          generational shift causes a change in the public perception as well as the role of the buildings.
        </p>
        <p>This reshaped meaning of Soviet architecture is apparent in the film When the Earth Seems to Be Light (2015).
          Situated in post-soviet Georgia, the film is a collection of impressions by a group of skateboarders on the
          current political climate and the environment they’re stuck in. Besides the stories they share, the characters
          are on a constant search for grey areas to create their own spaces of existence, inhabiting abandoned spaces
          and
          using the concrete structures for skateboarding (fig.10). The visuals of ruins strengthen the stories of the
          corrupt political environment, stemming from the socialist era. Current political notions however are no
          longer
          masked under symbols of utopia and dreamy prospects for the future. Now as Soviet ideology has left politics,
          the destruction of utopian symbols only signalises the loss of future in the country. Ruins become a shelter
          to
          people, searching for an escape from reality in forgotten buildings that were once envisioning unimagined
          realities. In that sense Soviet architecture already gains new connotations, becoming a backdrop to younger
          generations’ dreams for better (newly utopian) realities and their “romantic notions of free
          existence”<sup>17</sup>. It
          almost acquires a binary meaning: a dystopian space depicting the ongoing socio-political transition and
          traces
          from a flawed socialist system, as well as a romanticised space for escapism.

        <p>As part of the post-Communist generation, I have also encountered the shift in the meaning of Soviet
          buildings
          as well as the generational gap in perception of their role in our modern society. The Khrushchyovka style
          buildings were a consistent part of my childhood environment, as well as the stories of my family about the
          sublimity of the Soviet era, an idyllic picture of safety and exciting experiences. But to speak of safety is
          an
          exclusive privilege of the party members, and to believe in the indulgence of possibilities is an illusion
          created by censorship. The stories would be told with exhilaration, praising Socialist architecture as if
          society’s perception of reality was impaired by decades of propaganda and manipulation. The discussions would
          circle around the variety and comfort of summer resort accommodations, but there was also a place for
          admiration
          for the monumental buildings and pavilions that the Soviets designed and built, like the marvellous space
          saucer
          of Buzludzha.
        </p>
        <p>
          30 years after the fall of Communism, the Buzludzha monument is still standing tall on the mountain hill where
          it was once abandoned. The building was looted and partly destroyed in the ‘90s, but mostly it has suffered a
          slow decay over the years. Like my family, many Bulgarians to this day glorify the monument and its past,
          others
          consider it a useless ruin, a leftover of an oppressive era. While heated discussions over the worth of the
          building continue, a foundation for preservation initiated the Buzludzha project– a program aiming to halt the
          destruction of the interior mosaic artworks and restore the monument. Yet even their motives supporting the
          initiative are not convincing enough. It creates a paradox for the monument’s role as a communist symbol and
          one
          of transition to democracy, as a symbol of creating conflicts, yet unifying people.<sup>18</sup> In regards to
          the project,
          what I argue against is not the historic, architectural and cultural significance of the building, but rather
          the ignorance towards the monument’s past. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This lack of acknowledgement occurs in both former Communist and post-Communist generational perspectives.
          While
          the majority of people, who endured Socialism, long for the past, their nostalgia affects their sensible
          perception. They see these Soviet buildings through a selective memory, as what they used to be– astonishing
          pieces of architecture made possible by the Soviet state. But this only creates dissociation with the present
          and the realistic position of the buildings in modern urbanism and society. On the other hand, the
          post-communist generation overlooks the encrypted symbolism in the architecture and instead builds its own
          romanticised and aestheticised world around it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for this detachment of Soviet remnants from the ‘problematic and controversial’ label is the
          distant
          involvement in the act of subjugation. Back to the comparison with the Edward Colston monument, the implied
          and
          perceived symbolism of Soviet architecture differs from colonialist statues. The latter were ones of
          historical
          figures that engaged directly in immoral practices, similar to the Lenin and Stalin monuments which were
          demolished with the fall of Communism. Utopian architecture however doesn’t hold on to the same negative
          connotations, it was built to accommodate the worker in their daily life. But through its design, it came to
          be
          a carrier of utopian ideologies, which acted as a supporting system for society’s trust in Socialism. Ideally,
          architecture was a proxy of the doctrine, doubling as a distraction to the oppressive and corrupt reality of
          the
          political regime. This characteristic sets it apart from other problematic monuments by forming a grey area
          for
          its present existence. 
        </p>
        <h3>Capitalisation of ideology</h3>

        <p>In contrast to the former communist generation, the post-communist one isn’t influenced by the ideology and
          propaganda engraved in these obsolete structures. The shift in perception had also something to do with the
          shift in the political system and the beginning of the so-called ‘transition’. The Post-communist age was
          defined by loss of identity. Until that point identity was shaped by the socialist coercion, but after ’89
          became a subject to neoliberal capitalism.<sup>19</sup> While the subjects of post-communism struggled towards
          finding a
          sense of self, outside of the community and the state, they were pushed into re-creating themselves in an
          environment that was still dominated by communist dogmas. This was only a catalyst to capitalising leftovers
          from an ideology.   
        </p>
        <p>The topic of capitalism’s role in eradicating the historical and cultural value of architecture is unfolded
          in
          the short film Exile Exotic (2015) by Sasha Litvintseva. The film narrates the story of Moscow’s Kremlin and
          its
          sized down replica, which exists as a holiday resort in Antalya, Turkey (fig.11). It is a reflection on the
          uncanny fusion of a monument’s symbolism and hotel aesthetics. The original architectural piece is not
          considered Soviet architecture. However, its history is entangled in conflicts of politics, ideology and
          religion creating an indirect correlation with Soviet monuments’ symbolism and their metamorphosis in a
          capitalist age. Both have lost their identity hence their initial codified meaning, becoming an empty body
          controlled by the market and the consumer’s desires. While the Kremlin underwent self re-creation into an
          object
          fitting the capitalist model, most Soviet buildings were left into decay, which turned them into an
          aestheticised piece to younger generations. 
        </p>

        <small>Fig.11 Sasha Litvintseva, Exile Exotic (2016)</small>
        <p>An example of the capitalisation of Soviet remnants is the Grand Hotel Pristina in Kosovo (fig.12). It was
          considered one of the most esteemed architectural projects in former Yugoslavia, projecting power and progress
          through its appearance.<sup>20</sup> The Grand Hotel was turned into the “city’s societal hotspot” in the 80s
          by ideally
          fusing politics with social aims.<sup>21</sup> After the end of Communism and the split of Yugoslavia, the
          building was
          privatised and lost its past identity. The hotel still exists to this day, surfacing on the internet with
          disappointing online reviews. Part of the building however has been kept alive through the emergence of 13
          Rooftop– a nightclub situated on the top floor of the hotel (fig.13). This fusion of modern-day party culture
          with the gruesome concrete structures of a dilapidating Soviet building seems very unsettling at first, yet
          has
          become the reality for the post-communist generation.

        <small>Fig.13 13 Rooftop nightclub, Pristina, Kosovo</small>
        <p>This phenomenon is manifested through the term ruin porn– a concept that Exile Exotic glimpses at. What ruin
          porn conveys is the visual appeal of abandoned buildings and structures that had a future in the past but now
          only exist as lost ambition. Similar to what socialist utopia is. The concept is not as commonly observed in
          the
          physical inhabitation of Soviet remains but rather in how they are perceived and communicated. Architecture is
          being capitalised by the fastest growing market among young people– internet pop culture. Social media
          platforms
          become home to abandoned structures (fig.14). There they can be encapsulated with new meanings, formed by the
          same environment and the consumers entering it.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/fig14.png"><br>
        <small>Fig.14 Arseniy Kotov, @northern.friend.</small>
        <p>The inevitable act of re-identification through commodification descends even more when the ‘West’ takes
          over.
          Architectural pieces like the Buzludzha monument become capitalised by the western music and film industry.
          Hence their historical and cultural significance is not only neglected but twisted into a new disconnected
          narrative. In some cases, they are played as a proxy for the ‘Soviet’ or ‘Russian’ identity. In others they
          are
          completely stripped of their symbolism and downplayed as a pure form of aesthetic, being further romanticised
          or
          even poeticised (fig.15). In the effort for re-establishment of Soviet architecture, pop culture turns into a
          faux lifebelt helping it resurface. Instead of re-introducing it realistically, it reshapes it to fit the
          modern
          capitalist environment. Through this act, the codified ideology is rather buried and forgotten than
          acknowledged
          and taken into account. This only proves that capitalisation of Soviet remnants is an appropriation of their
          cultural and historical value. Furthermore, it forges a false representation of an architectural piece, which
          deludes society into how to perceive and exploit it.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Architecture, similar to any existing object or piece of art, is built with a certain intention, either
          purely
          functional, infused with ideology, or in the case of Soviet architecture– both. While art can certainly be
          viewed through the lens of personal interpretation, the political and cultural environment it has evolved in,
          establishes its larger meaning. It is the codified meaning that surpasses time and change through the body it
          is
          encapsulated in. With that being said, Soviet architecture was created as a physical extension of the
          communist
          ideology that reaches out and occupies the social realm. It becomes a direct link to the proclaimed dogmas of
          the Soviet state, which surge into the prospects for a utopian future. This viewpoint disproves the possible
          link to the acts of oppression, manipulation and injustice exercised by the state. This explains why they
          haven’t been destroyed but left into decay.
        </p>
        <p>In the current day and age, these Soviet structures still represent the same utopian dreams and prospects but
          are rather seen as unrealised ambitions of the past communist state. In reality, this symbolism has been
          stripped away, remodelled or morphed to fit capitalist desires. Soviet architecture is forced into a new
          meaning. For the Post-Soviet generation, the structures become a symbol of the contemporary socio-political
          reality of corruption and stagnation. But with the development of pop culture and through western influence,
          it
          becomes exploited only for its appearance. This capitalisation of symbols, regardless of their ideology, is
          comparable to cultural and historical appropriation. It introduces a false representation of architecture with
          a
          socio-political value and creates a cycle of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>It is natural that the identity of a structure would fade away over time, especially when the purpose it was
          meant to serve is no longer viable in a new political environment. However, from my standpoint as a graphic
          designer, I approach any symbol, whether art or architecture, as a carrier of ideas through time. Even if a
          building loses relevance or specific, intended meaning, the job of a designer is to repurpose it in a form
          that
          justifies its historical significance in our present. I would argue for a multi-generational perspective on
          the
          meaning of obsolete structures in order to bridge the gap between differing experiences and points of view.
          Rather than using structures mindlessly as a backdrop, it could become the main character, telling а story of
          the social metamorphosis, from members of a united nation to ego-driven individualists. I started this
          research
          fascinated by the complexity of Soviet architecture. But it remains a challenge to imagine how I could
          preserve
          and repurpose these remnants as a graphic designer, without causing any further damage.
